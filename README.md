# Beginning_LangChain 0.3

This repository contains the code for the book "**Beginning LangChain 0.3**".

## Book's description
LangChain is one of the new frameworks designed for building generative AI (GenAI) applications with large language models (LLMs). 
Sparked by the emergence of ChatGPT and other generative AI systems, there is now a growing demand for developers who can harness LLMs across various sectors of the economy. Amidst this explosion of demand, proficiency in LangChain has become one of today’s most sought-after skills. This book offers a unique opportunity to pick up this skill. 
There are three key reasons to learn LangChain:
•	Built atop critical Python packages, LangChain streamlines the creation of generative AI applications by providing coherent access to the otherwise fragmented network of tools.
•	It promotes the building of modular, repeatable components that support robust and maintainable enterprise applications.
•	The LangChain ecosystem offers a unified interface to essential accessories, ranging from tracing and monitoring to deployment that supports the full development lifecycle of LLM-focused applications.

## Why learn LangChain from this book? 
The book emphasises problem-solving strategies. With each chapter infused with a carefully laid out scaffolding introduction to build up intuition of LangChain concepts and thoughtfully arranged code recipes demonstrating applications, this book will help you get to grips with the core components of LangChain for building GenAI applications. 

## What to expect:
•	Discover how to harness LangChain's prompt template, few-shot template, and chat prompt template to inject prompt engineering techniques into your application logic.
•	Experiment with runnables and understand how to leverage them to implement input routing and LLM-as-judge workflow
•	Gain clarity on how to build a lightweight multi-source RAG workflow that incorporates document processing, vector search, embedding model, and third-party vector stores. 
•	Learn how to evaluate RAG and how to use evaluation metrics to identify the inadequacy of a RAG pipeline to drive its improvement.
•	Understand how to move beyond leaning on LangChain’s off-the-shelf evaluator to more advanced evaluation packages, such as DeepEval, in the evaluation procedure
•	Work with LangChain’s specialized functionalities for interfacing with OpenAI GPT models and HF models

## Bonus:
•	Each chapter is supported by copious references to useful technical blogs and relevant academic articles for further reading and exploration.  
•	A companion repository for keeping code examples current. 

## Who this book is for:
Primarily, this book is for beginners seeking a friendly, application-focused introduction to LangChain. This comprises students, researchers, developers, aspiring GenAI engineers, and ML engineers interested in crafting generative AI products with LangChain.
